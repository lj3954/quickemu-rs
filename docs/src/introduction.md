# Introduction

[quickemu-rs][homepage] is a collection of two Rust programs, quickget and quickemu, each of which are designed to simplify the
creation and running of Virtual Machines. This documentation specifically covers the usage of these two programs in their
CLI forms, including configuration options.

> quickemu-rs uses [QEMU][qemu-homepage] under the hood to allow for large amounts of configurability.
