All parts of quickget-rs are licensed under the GPLv3-only license. Full text can be found in the LICENSE-GPLv3 file.
Quickemu-rs is dual licensed under GPLv2-only and GPLv3-only. This is done to allow QEMU to be statically linked with the produced binary in the future, simplifying distribution of quickemu-rs in containerized formats or where a builtin QEMU is otherwise wanted.
